# 💌 Valentine's Day Love Letter Website

## Page Flow

### 1. Landing Page — The Envelope
- A beautifully styled envelope sitting in the center of the screen with a cute pink/red Valentine's theme
- Subtle floating hearts animation in the background
- The envelope has a "tap to open" hint
- When clicked, the envelope opens with a smooth animation revealing the letter inside

### 2. The Letter — "Will You Be My Valentine?"
- A romantic letter unfolds from the envelope with the question: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**
- Two buttons: **Yes 💕** and **No**
- The **No** button runs away! Every time she tries to click it, it jumps to a random position on the screen — making it impossible to press
- The **Yes** button stays put and is the only real option 😄
- When **Yes** is clicked, a celebration moment happens (confetti, hearts, etc.)

### 3. The Flip — Personal Message
- After pressing Yes, the letter flips over with a smooth animation
- On the back side:
  - A photo of you two together (you'll be able to set the image)
  - A custom love message/text underneath the photo
- Sweet background music vibes (optional) and a warm, cozy design

## Design & Vibe
- **Color palette**: Soft pinks, reds, and warm whites
- **Typography**: Handwritten/script-style fonts for a personal, romantic feel
- **Animations**: Floating hearts, envelope opening, letter flip, confetti on "Yes"
- **Responsive**: Works beautifully on both phone and desktop so she can open it anywhere
